Navigation Menu:

Build an interactive navigation menu that changes its color or style when:

Scrolled (changes as the user scrolls through the page).

Hovered over (changes when the mouse pointer moves over the menu items).

Fixed Position:


The navigation menu should have a fixed position on the page, meaning it remains visible even when the user scrolls down.
It should be accessible and visible across all pages of the site.
Technologies:

HTML:Used to structure the navigation menu and other elements of the landing page.

CSS: Styles the appearance of the navigation bar, including color changes on hover or scroll.

JavaScript: Adds interactivity by dynamically changing the background color, font color, or other styles when the page is scrolled or when hovering over menu items.

Responsive Design:

Ensure that the landing page is responsive, meaning it adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
This task will help in understanding how to build visually engaging, responsive, and interactive web pages using front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). It emphasizes user experience by improving navigation and the overall look and feel of the landing page.
